# umbracraft
UmbraCraft is a toolkit to help java developers build highly-customizable, cross-platform 2.5D role playing games (RPGs). Built using libgdx, the toolkit includes an engine to play RPGs and an editor to maintain the game’s data (characters, items, animations, scripted cutscenes, areas, npcs, and so on).
